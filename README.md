# Getting Started

This project contains a basic rock-paper-scissors-style Discord app written in JavaScript.
(https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

## Project structure
Below is a basic overview of the project structure:

```
├── examples    -> short, feature-specific sample apps
│   ├── app.js  -> finished app.js code
│   ├── button.js
│   ├── command.js
│   ├── modal.js
│   ├── selectMenu.js
├── .env.sample -> sample .env file
├── app.js      -> main entrypoint for app
├── commands.js -> slash command payloads + helpers
├── game.js     -> logic specific to RPS
├── utils.js    -> utility functions and enums
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

## Running app locally

Before you start, you'll need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [create a Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the proper permissions:
- `applications.commands`
- `bot` (with Send Messages enabled)


### Setup project

First clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/ryansmith122000/discord-bot.git
```

Then navigate to its directory and install dependencies:
```
cd discord-bot-main
npm install
```
### Get app credentials

Fetch the credentials from your app's settings and add them to a `.env` file (see `.env.sample` for an example). You'll need your app ID (`APP_ID`), bot token (`DISCORD_TOKEN`), and public key (`PUBLIC_KEY`).

Fetching credentials is covered in detail in the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

> 🔑 Environment variables can be added to the `.env` file.

### Install slash commands

The commands for the example app are set up in `commands.js`. All of the commands in the `ALL_COMMANDS` array at the bottom of `commands.js` will be installed when you run the `register` command configured in `package.json`:

```
npm run register
```

### Run the app

After your credentials are added, go ahead and run the app:

```
node app.js
```
### Set up interactivity

The project needs a public endpoint where Discord can send requests. To develop and test locally, you can use something like [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel HTTP traffic.

Install ngrok if you haven't already, then start listening on port `3000`:

```
ngrok http 3000
```

You should see your connection open:

```
